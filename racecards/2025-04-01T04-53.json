He fell on his first chase start of the season at Warwick, but his second run when third to Edwardstone at the same track last month was much better, which was a fair effort considering the winner franked the form at Grade 1 level next time out. He dropped in class last time at Plumpton and was electric over his fences, coming home 37 lengths clear of Nassalam. Even if the favourite was a little off his best, it was still a terrific performance. I suspect he will head to Doncaster next for the Grade 2 Lightning Novices' Chase at the end of next month. His success at Plumpton provides him with the opportunity of a £50,000 bonus if he is successful at the festival and his owner is naturally keen to go there, but I would lean a little more towards Aintree. He'll have as light a campaign as possible in case we take in both of those races. 30-12-21"}],"number":1,"draw":0,"headgear":"t","headgear_first":"","lbs":168,"ofr":124,"rpr":124,"ts":104,"jockey":"Sean Bowen","jockey_id":93186,"last_run":"18","form":"5-4215","trainer_rtf":"65","stats":{"course":{"runs":"3","wins":"1"},"distance":{"runs":"1","wins":"0"},"going":{"runs":"13","wins":"3"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"33","last_14_wins":"9","last_14_wins_pct":"27%","last_14_profit":"-3.32","ovr_runs":"30","ovr_wins":"5","ovr_wins_pct":"17%","ovr_profit":"-10.69"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"17","last_14_wins":"7","last_14_wins_pct":"41%","last_14_profit":"+14.86","ovr_runs":"65","ovr_wins":"16","ovr_wins_pct":"25%","ovr_profit":"-17.89"}}},{"age":9,"horse_id":3316966,"name":"Watergrange Jack","dob":"2016-04-25","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"b","region":"IRE","breeder":"Peter S McLoughlin","dam":"Prestissimo","dam_region":"GB","sire":"Sintarajan","sire_region":"IRE","grandsire":"Barathea","damsire":"Alzao","damsire_region":"USA","trainer":"Neil Mulholland","trainer_id":20451,"trainer_location":"Limpley Stoke, Wilts","trainer_14_days":{"runs":14,"wins":4,"percent":29},"owner":"Jane Nuala Cartwright","prev_trainers":[{"trainer":"Patrick Joseph Hayes","trainer_id":17756,"change_date":"2021-12-27"},{"trainer":"Peter Fahey","trainer_id":22959,"change_date":"2021-05-25"}],"prev_owners":[{"owner":"Peter S McLoughlin","owner_id":117700,"change_date":"2021-12-27"}],"comment":"Worth considering now reverting to hurdles back on a winnable mark for his in-form stable.","spotlight":"Four-time winner over hurdles, all at around this distance on good ground; gained a first chase win in September but has not had things go to plan since and was last seen pulling up at Kelso in October; has gone well back from a break in the past and he's worth considering now back on a winnable mark for his in-form stable.","quotes":[{"date":"2023-09-10","horse":"Watergrange Jack","horse_id":3316966,"race":"bet365 Handicap Hurdle","race_id":846909,"course":"Fontwell","course_id":20,"distance_f":19,"distance_y":4229,"quote":"It was a brave performance.
