I think the lack of crowds has certainly helped a lot of the more nervous individuals and it is possible that was why he was so good. The trip was wrong but he still ran a fine race to be second. He is a lovely prospect but still very immature and I am sure there is more to come. He has an entry in the Ladbrokes Trophy at Newbury, but to be honest although it is a great race I am not a great fan of it as horses often have a very tough race there.

It means you can go at your speed very comfortably. He can go through it in second gear, and that's great. He made it a bit harder work, visually, than he did the last day. He was fitter the last day, I just did a lot with him for the first day, he's a very exuberant horse so I pressed him a bit. I didn't want him too fresh and I've done less with him. He's jumped the last and had a bit of a blow. Originally the plan was to come here then the Henry VIII, but whether that'll definitely happen I'll need to talk to Mike (Newbould, owner). I could leave him until Kempton (Wayward Lad) but the ground would have a big bearing - there's no way I'd run him on soft or heavy.

He was sold to go to Hong Kong, but he worked very well at mine so I asked if I could run him at York. He ran at York and won, and we decided to go for one more today.
