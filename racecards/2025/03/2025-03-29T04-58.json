The handicapper then gave us a mark of 92 which is clearly far too high, but I realise they are only doing their job. Clearly horses are penalised for running in races like that as he is now on a very harsh mark, whereas if we had gone for a handicap instead of the Craven he would have been thrown in off 81. They are keen to encourage horses to run in the better races and help nurture good-sized fields but if the price is an 11lb hike then the incentive is not there, and I think they need a re-think and should consider a more considerate approach to horses like Mr Mistoffelees. 17-05-23"}],"number":5,"draw":1,"headgear":"","headgear_first":"","lbs":131,"ofr":74,"rpr":94,"ts":75,"jockey":"Paul Mulrennan","jockey_id":79371,"last_run":"15","form":"00-334","trainer_rtf":"50","stats":{"course":{"runs":"0","wins":"0"},"distance":{"runs":"3","wins":"0"},"going":{"runs":"4","wins":"0"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"15","last_14_wins":"3","last_14_wins_pct":"20%","last_14_profit":"+1.25","ovr_runs":"772","ovr_wins":"117","ovr_wins_pct":"15%","ovr_profit":"-71.86"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"5","last_14_wins":"1","last_14_wins_pct":"20%","last_14_profit":"+1.50","ovr_runs":"73","ovr_wins":"5","ovr_wins_pct":"7%","ovr_profit":"-48.13"}}},{"age":5,"horse_id":4982050,"name":"Federated","dob":"2020-05-22","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"b","region":"USA","breeder":"Newtownanner Stud","dam":"Indy Punch","dam_region":"USA","sire":"War Front","sire_region":"USA","grandsire":"Danzig","damsire":"Pulling Punches","damsire_region":"USA","trainer":"John Butler","trainer_id":26177,"trainer_location":"Newmarket, Suffolk","trainer_14_days":{"runs":18,"wins":1,"percent":6},"owner":"Newtown Anner Stud Farm Ltd","prev_trainers":[{"trainer":"D K Weld","trainer_id":1010,"change_date":"2023-12-13"}],"prev_owners":[{"owner":"J Butler","owner_id":12139,"change_date":"2025-02-27"},{"owner":"Newtown Anner Stud Farm Ltd","owner_id":159428,"change_date":"2023-12-13"}],"comment":"Record of 1121 since upped to middle distances; open to further progress","spotlight":"Record of 1121 since upped to middle distances, scoring comfortably at Newcastle most recently; highly respected with further progress plausible.","quotes":[{"date":"2025-01-23","horse":"Federated","horse_id":4982050,"race":"Extra Winnings With BetUK Acca Club Handicap","race_id":884570,"course":"Newcastle (AW)","course_id":1353,"distance_f":12.5,"distance_y":2738,"quote":"It was like a piece of work to be honest.

We decided he had to take his place in the 2,000 Guineas but he never got a chance to show his true colours. He got wiped out at the start, which caused him to lose his action, and from there on things never went right. Unfortunately he came back sore, having knocked a joint. It has been hard work getting him back but he's there now and ready to go again. I looked at Royal Ascot but he had a slightly dirty scope before and you must be 100 per cent for that meeting. He heads to Newmarket for the July meeting, where we'll aim for the Listed Sir Henry Cecil Stakes over a mile and then we'll look to the Thoroughbred Stakes at Glorious Goodwood. He'll run at Newmarket as long as they get nice ground and hopefully we can get him back to where he was before the Guineas.

He's a big, scopey horse who stayed very well on the Flat and I wasn't sure he'd have the tactical speed for it. I thought he'd be running on and collecting some nice prize-money but it was a pleasant surprise how much speed he showed to win - the sprint times from the race were very good and his finishing percentage was outstanding. He has a terrific attitude and showed that in spades at Musselburgh. I'd like to get him qualified for the novices' championship final at Sandown on the last day of the season, so I suppose I might go for a qualifier at Newbury in a few weeks' time and then look at something like the juvenile handicap at Ascot at the end of March before going on to Sandown. That would be my plan A, but if he improves in spades again and takes himself to a rating where we think we should be having a crack at something like Aintree, that would be fantastic.

She looks like she's strengthened up loads and I think we'll have a bit of fun again this year. Soft ground is paramount for her. The only bad run she had was at York and I was kicking myself for running as I walked the track and it was too quick, but we thought we have to try her on quick ground at some stage. We know now it's not her gig. As soon as she got back on to soft, she relished it again and finished off the season really strongly. We were struggling for a race to start her off this time and ended up running her over 7f at Haydock, which is too short but we needed to get a run into her. She's got loads of options but it's down to the weather. There's the Group 3 Princess Elizabeth at Epsom on Saturday and then Royal Ascot.
