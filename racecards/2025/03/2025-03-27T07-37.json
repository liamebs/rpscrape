To be fair to him, he's a fast-ground horse but he won on soft at Catterick the time before last. It was soft ground that you could go through and a few of the fancied ones didn't run because the ground changed overnight and we thought we'd got nothing to lose. We'd got an outside stall, where we could get over to the golden highway, and the worst thing we could do was get beat. After about a furlong, he was never going to get beat.
