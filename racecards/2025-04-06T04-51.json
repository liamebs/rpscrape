The day he gets his conditions he will put up a very different level of form to last time. As a two-year-old he won both starts, the latter a Listed race at Toulouse, but this year things have not been in his favour. His first run back was in the Sandown Classic Trial, where he lost a shoe and came back very sore for a while. I felt he ran a stormer next time out in the Dante despite the going as we had nowhere else to go. Now he is ready to go again but I am going to wait for the rain and do the right thing by the horse. I have a lot of time for him and he is possibly the best three-year-old I have ever trained, which I know sounds a big statement when you consider Wonderful Tonight, won two Group 1s last year, but I really believe he has that potential. When he gets everything in his favour he will raise a few eyebrows and we have him in at Royal Ascot as well as the Grand Prix de Paris [on July 14] and then we have to decide whether to go down the St Leger route as there are a lot of stayers in his family or shorter, when the Arc could be an option. The form of his Listed win last year has taken quite a boost as the runner-up, Cirona, subsequently won a Group 3 and was a head second in the Group 1 Prix Saint-Alary at Longchamp. Olivier Peslier rode him on that occasion and he regularly rings me up to inquire how the horse is doing, which pretty much says it all. Keep an eye out for him as I am sure he'll be worth the wait. 02-06-21"}],"number":2,"draw":null,"headgear":"t","headgear_first":"","lbs":158,"ofr":129,"rpr":141,"ts":122,"jockey":"Danny Mullins","jockey_id":87524,"last_run":"28","form":"158","trainer_rtf":"49","stats":{"course":{"runs":"1","wins":"0"},"distance":{"runs":"3","wins":"1"},"going":{"runs":"1","wins":"0"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"12","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-12.00","ovr_runs":"183","ovr_wins":"23","ovr_wins_pct":"13%","ovr_profit":"-4.54"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"43","last_14_wins":"15","last_14_wins_pct":"35%","last_14_profit":"+42.12","ovr_runs":"478","ovr_wins":"125","ovr_wins_pct":"26%","ovr_profit":"-42.02"}}},{"age":6,"horse_id":4867653,"name":"Downmexicoway","dob":"2019-03-19","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"ch","region":"IRE","breeder":"Rosemary Hutch","dam":"On The Way Home","dam_region":"IRE","sire":"Champs Elysees","sire_region":"GB","grandsire":"Danehill","damsire":"Flemensfirth","damsire_region":"USA","trainer":"Henry De Bromhead","trainer_id":1249,"trainer_location":"Knockeen, Co Waterford","trainer_14_days":{"runs":31,"wins":3,"percent":10},"owner":"Basil Holian","prev_trainers":[{"trainer":"Peter Fahey","trainer_id":22959,"change_date":"2024-09-19"}],"prev_owners":null,"comment":"Distant second behind Karniquet at Tramore, took advantage of good Down Royal opportunity","spotlight":"Point winner; made a bright start for the stable when narrowly losing out in a Galway maiden; distant second behind Karniquet at Tramore in November; took advantage of a good opportunity at Down Royal in December.","quotes":null,"stable_tour":[{"horse":"Downmexicoway","horse_id":4867653,"quote":"He's a nice young horse.
