He's done a lot of jumping and it's not impossible he could go straight over hurdles for the National Hunt three-year-old hurdler series. I don't know if he's another Elvis Mail in the making but Ginger Mail wasn't either and he's progressed to a mark of 126. The family improves and I'd love to think this chap could be the same.
