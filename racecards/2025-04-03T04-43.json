He normally needs his races spaced out and isn't the easiest to train, so although I could bring him out again fairly quick in the Paddy Power Gold Cup, he's more likely to wait for the December Gold Cup at Cheltenham next month. It gives him a bit more time and he likes to be fresh. As he has to go left-handed our options are limited, and I can't help feeling he's not going to be easy to place this season; he could find himself in no man's land - on a mark that's a few pounds too high for handicaps and holding few options in Grade 2s as a lot of them are run at right-handed tracks that are no good for him.

It's not always straightforward.I don't want to keep him hidden away ? I'll have people coming to see him every day before the Champion Hurdle, half media and half private ? but although he may go away for a gallop, where and when is yet to be decided, and I'm not even sure he needs to. Nico [de Boinville] will sit on him this week and we'll make our minds up from there.
