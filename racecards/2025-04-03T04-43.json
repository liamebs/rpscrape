He normally needs his races spaced out and isn't the easiest to train, so although I could bring him out again fairly quick in the Paddy Power Gold Cup, he's more likely to wait for the December Gold Cup at Cheltenham next month.

As he has to go left-handed our options are limited, and I can't help feeling he's not going to be easy to place this season; he could find himself in no man's land - on a mark that's a few pounds too high for handicaps and holding few options in Grade 2s as a lot of them are run at right-handed tracks that are no good for him.

It's not always straightforward.I don't want to keep him hidden away ? I'll have people coming to see him every day before the Champion Hurdle, half media and half private ? but although he may go away for a gallop, where and when is yet to be decided, and I'm not even sure he needs to. Nico [de Boinville] will sit on him this week and we'll make our minds up from there.
