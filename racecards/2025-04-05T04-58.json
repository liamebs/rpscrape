The timing of Punchestown would be perfect, but I'd have to look what races they've got and the ground would have to be right. He'd go chasing in the autumn and with another year on his back he'd be an exciting prospect. When we held him up earlier in the season, we broke his stride and he probably hasn't got a turn of foot.

I even had £5 each-way myself as I thought the odds were so generous. Although we never expect him to win first time out, I was expecting a good run. He backed that up at Newcastle over 1m2f next time out and earned a mark of 88. Last month at Sandown on his turf debut I was disappointed that he finished fourth, and yet the second and third each won next time out so possibly it was a hot handicap. He was quite immature as he kept changing his legs and just did not know which leg to put in front. Don't lose faith in him as he is a nice type and a mark of 88 is not harsh. 25-05-22"}],"number":3,"draw":9,"headgear":"","headgear_first":"","lbs":127,"ofr":121,"rpr":136,"ts":null,"jockey":"Oisin Murphy","jockey_id":92728,"last_run":"118","form":"51131-","trainer_rtf":"45","stats":{"course":{"runs":"2","wins":"0"},"distance":{"runs":"2","wins":"2"},"going":{"runs":"8","wins":"2"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"23","last_14_wins":"4","last_14_wins_pct":"17%","last_14_profit":"-12.33","ovr_runs":"28","ovr_wins":"0","ovr_wins_pct":"0%","ovr_profit":"-28.00"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"11","last_14_wins":"1","last_14_wins_pct":"9%","last_14_profit":"-6.00","ovr_runs":"14","ovr_wins":"0","ovr_wins_pct":"0%","ovr_profit":"-14.00"}}},{"age":7,"horse_id":3241322,"name":"Rebels Romance","dob":"2018-03-19","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"br","region":"IRE","breeder":"Godolphin","dam":"Minidress","dam_region":"GB","sire":"Dubawi","sire_region":"IRE","grandsire":"Dubai Millennium","damsire":"Street Cry","damsire_region":"IRE","trainer":"Charlie Appleby","trainer_id":28338,"trainer_location":"Newmarket, Suffolk","trainer_14_days":{"runs":3,"wins":1,"percent":33},"owner":"Godolphin","prev_trainers":null,"prev_owners":null,"comment":"High-class middle-distance performer with fine strike-rate; bids to win it for second year","spotlight":"High-class middle-distance performer with a tremendous strike-rate and he bids to win this for the second year in succession; didn't have to be at his best to win in Qatar last time after a break of over three months and has leading claims back in Dubai.","quotes":[{"date":"2025-02-16","horse":"Rebel's Romance","horse_id":3241322,"race":"H H The Amir Trophy (Group 3) (4yo+) (Turf)","race_id":888102,"course":"Al Uqda","course_id":1692,"distance_f":11.5,"distance_y":2530,"quote":"Rebel's Romance is a horse of a lifetime.

He was a bit laid-back so he took time to learn and adjust as the race progressed, but he's got a lovely big stride and is a horse who has a future. I'll have to talk to the Middleham Park team about plans and we might just feel our way gradually and have a bigger target towards the end of the year or we could pitch him in somewhere nicer next time, but we'll see how he is. He's an exciting horse, but he's still got a bit to learn and is a bit raw. He'd shown enough at home, plenty to be honest, but he's so laid-back, which was a little concern of mine and that's maybe why he was a longer price than he should have been. I think he's more 6f than 5f and he may get further next year; his stride is quite eyecatching and he seems to do everything effortlessly as you could see with Danny, who didn't have to give him any urgings.
