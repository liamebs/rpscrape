His work has always been decent and I thought stepping him up to 6f next time out at Redcar would see him win. But, despite running a smashing race, he had to take second behind Happier. He ran back over the same course and distance last time when he was third but came back rather sore, hence he hasn't run in more than two months. He's sound again now and an opening mark of 67 looks attractive to me. I'm not sure whether he'll go for another maiden or straight to a handicap.

working closely with the 'Rogues'. Obviously he has a lovely pedigree and was purchased at the breeze-ups. He never saw a racecourse until April when a very impressive winner at Yarmouth over 1m2f. He didn't enjoy the heavy ground next time out when second to Perfuse, but on much quicker ground at Ripon last time he was a comfortable winner under a penalty. He had been given an entry in the King George V Stakes at Royal Ascot and was around 16-1 when we scratched him. We have had to be very patient with this colt and Tony [Elliott] and the Rogues have been very supportive, as they always are. He has won over 1m2f and 1m3f and I don't think 1m4f will pose any problems and he could even get 1m6f in time. His opening handicap mark is 90, which was to be expected after his two wins in novice company. There is a three-year-old handicap at Ascot which is run on that extraordinarily busy Saturday when the July Cup is run which is an option, but he is entered to run in the 1m6f handicap at Haydock this week. There is definitely more to come from him this year. 06-07-23"}],"number":7,"draw":0,"headgear":"h","headgear_first":"","lbs":159,"ofr":null,"rpr":94,"ts":69,"jockey":"Sean

So now we're in the unusual position of having a horse highly rated on the Flat who is lowly rated over hurdles. Hopefully, that's something we can now take advantage of when he reappears in the two-mile novice handicap at Cheltenham's Paddy Power meeting. He probably wants a bit further, but if they go a good gallop that should suit him. He had a nice run round at Wincanton in their charity race eight days ago and that was ideal.
