He was one of those where we probably bought him at the right time as his rating was down into the 60s. He was running well without doing an awful lot, but when he got down to a mark of 50 he started winning. We put a visor on and it helped a bit, but it wasn't until he got the blinkers on that things started to happen. Even the first day he won at Nottingham, I still maintain that if he hadn't got a bump near the finish, he'd have finished second; he got a bump and seemed to take off and won really well. He then went to Beverley and had a bit of a troubled passage but got to the front and was well on top at the finish. When he went to Wetherby for his third success, the ground was plenty quick enough for him and the race didn't go as smoothly as we'd have liked, but he still won, whiwas fair play to him. He's got his confidence back and remembered how to win. If he wants to win again, he's still a long way ahead of the handicapper.

He won his maiden hurdle at Cork last month by 17 lengths, which brought him on a good deal, so much so that we stepped him up to Grade 3 company last week in the Surehaul Mercedez-Benz Novices' Hurdle at Clonmel and he did the job nicely, coming home by five lengths. It was heavy ground, a real stamina test, and the further they went the stronger he looked. It is a race I like to use as a stepping stone to Cheltenham having run both Monalee and Minella Indo in it in recent seasons. He clearly stays all day and jumps so well. He is in the Albert Bartlett, and I know the owners are very keen to run him in the race. He is an exciting prospect and is fully entitled to his place in the Cheltenham team. 23-02-22"}],"number":24,"draw":0,"headgear":"p","headgear_first":"","lbs":146,"ofr":136,"rpr":158,"ts":136,"jockey":"Darragh Okeeffe","jockey_id":96391,"last_run":"34","form":"7-3F72","trainer_rtf":"36","stats":{"course":{"runs":"1","wins":"0"},"distance":{"runs":"7","wins":"0"},"going":{"runs":"1","wins":"0"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"17","last_14_wins":"1","last_14_wins_pct":"6%","last_14_profit":"-14.38","ovr_runs":"14","ovr_wins":"0","ovr_wins_pct":"0%","ovr_profit":"-14.00"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"20","last_14_wins":"1","last_14_wins_pct":"5%","last_14_profit":"-13.00","ovr_runs":"43","ovr_wins":"3","ovr_wins_pct":"7%","ovr_profit":"-18.50"}}},{"age":10,"horse_id":2630751,"name":"Jetoile","dob":"2015-04-24","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"b","region":"IRE","breeder":"Patricia Prenderville","dam":"Accordingtoherself","dam_region":"IRE","sire":"Jeremy","sire_region":"USA","grandsire":"Danehill Dancer","damsire":"Accordion","damsire_region":"IRE","trainer":"Ryan Potter","trainer_id":26798,"trainer_location":"Sellack, H'fords","trainer_14_days":{"runs":6,"wins":2,"percent":33},"owner":"Ms J Bennett","prev_trainers":[{"trainer":"R Black","trainer_id":38238,"change_date":"2021-05-28"}],"prev_owners":[{"owner":"R Black","owner_id":100595,"change_date":"2021-05-28"}],"comment":"Well treated on form as recent as last May but this 10yo has struggled in the main since","spotlight":"Won the Old Roan here (2m4f, good to soft) in October 2023 and good fourth at Punchestown (2m4f, good to yielding) last May; well treated on that form and this 10yo showed spark when second of five at Newcastle in February, but he's struggled in the main this term and was pulled up at Kempton latest.","quotes":[{"date":"2023-10-29","horse":"Jetoile","horse_id":2630751,"race":"Jewson Fast Set Finish Old Roan Limited Handicap Chase (Grade 2) (GBB Race)","race_id":850727,"course":"Aintree","course_id":32,"distance_f":20,"distance_y":4380,"quote":"This has been the target since the day we turned out Jetoile after winning at Chepstow.

He has a very tender mouth, as we saw at Punchestown. I think he has a lot of tactical speed, but he didn't jump so well last time because they were going so slow. After looking like he had blown up, once he got his second wind he just came through and won convincingly. I loved it. It takes a good horse to do that in good company.
